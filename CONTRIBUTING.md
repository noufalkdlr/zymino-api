# Contributing

Hi there! 👋

Thank you for your interest in this project. Currently, I am maintaining this project for my personal learning and development goals.

At this stage, **I am not accepting any Pull Requests (PRs) or external code contributions.** I want to keep the codebase consistent with my personal vision for the project.

However, feel free to:

- **Fork** the repository and experiment with your own changes.
- **Open an Issue** if you find any bugs or have suggestions (I'll try to check them when I'm free).

Thanks for understanding!

## ⚠️ Note on Contributions

Hi there! 👋
Thank you for your interest in **Zymino**. Currently, I am maintaining this project for my personal learning and development goals.

At this stage, **I am not accepting any Pull Requests (PRs) or external code contributions.** I want to keep the codebase consistent with my personal vision and learning path.

However, feel free to:
* **Fork** the repository and experiment with your own changes.
* **Open an Issue** if you find any bugs or have suggestions (I'll check them as time permits).

Thanks for understanding!
